//NOTE: I am using this api key for demo purpose so I am showing this apiKey publicly. But whenever I use this API key in production I will use the API key by environment variable.
const apiKey = "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";

/**
 * TODO:
 * Write JavaScript code for user input:

 * Test the application:
    Test the application by sending different messages and verifying the responses.
    Check for any errors or unexpected behavior.
    Debug and fix issues as needed.
 * Refactor and optimize the code:
    Review and optimize the JavaScript code for efficiency and readability.
    Consider modularizing the code into separate functions or modules.
    Remove any redundant or unused code.
    Ensure that the code follows best practices and is maintainable.
 * Document the code:
    Add comments to explain important implementation details.
    Provide usage instructions for running the application.
    Include any specific instructions for obtaining and using the API key.
